## This is my final FRT project
### **Industry Name**: Earth
#### **Problem Statement/Opportunity**: 
Managing sales and product logs are difficult for a farmer to manage. For this, I have created a website named AgriculturalFarm (Agrofarm). On my AgriculturalFarm website, I have created an interface that will help the customers and the farmer community to communicate better. Farmers can manage their business branding and can sell their products. This website allows customers to place an order and get healthy and fresh products at affordable prices at their doorsteps.
#### **Project Description**:  
In this project, I have created an agricultural farming website called Agrowfarm. This website is built using HTML, CSS, and javascript. It helps customers to choose the best, fresh and healthy products. Products include Agriculture Products, Fresh Vegetables, and Dairy Products. The website includes 4 pages (sections) named home, about, services, and contact. For better vision, a dark and light theme switch component is created. For providing better support message sending system and map location is embedded. This website is helpful to customers to interact with farmers. The selling of products and availability of products to customers can be made easy through this website.  The customer can place an order, call, and submit queries. The website may be used to manage the tasks and for growing business connections of farming-related products. I have created attractive user designs that customers can attract easily. 
#### **website benefits**: 
1. The longevity of the platform
2. Ease of management
3. Order Fulfillment
4. Customer Experience.
#### **Primary Azure Technology**: 
1. Static Web Apps   
2. Visual Studio Code
